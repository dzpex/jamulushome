# Installation for Macintosh

You want to run Jamulus on macOS? To install the client and server follow these instructions.

1. **[Download the latest version of Jamulus](https://sourceforge.net/projects/llcon/files/)**
1. **Extract the downloaded .zip file.** Double-click on the .zip file, which will create new folder of same name. The folder contains the license file and a `.dmg` file containing the application.
1. **Double-click the `.dmg` file** to open it. It will unpack and you will see two files (Jamulus client and server)
1. **Drag and drop both icons into your Applications folder** to install Jamulus.
1. **Run Jamulus**. Now you should be able to use Jamulus just like any other application. If you see a message which tells you that Jamulus can't be opened because the developer can't be verified, read on and have a look at the following section.

_You can remove the folder in the Downloads directory containing the `.dmg` and eject the "Jamulus" drive on your desktop. They are no longer needed._

You can also [compile your own binary](Compiling) if you feel so inclined.

## "Jamulus" can't be opened because the developer cannot be verified

**The first time you try to double-click Jamulus to run it, you will probably see a message saying it cannot be opened.**

To fix this, navigate to the Applications folder via Finder click on Jamulus, right-click (or control-click), and select "Open" from the top of the menu.

You will then get a slightly different version of the same message, which allows you to click Open and go ahead with running it. You will not be shown this warning again - just double-click it to run after that.
