# Command Line Options

While the most common functions in Jamulus can be set using the GUI, Jamulus can also be controlled using these options on the command line. Exactly how you do this will depend on your operating system. 

For example, on Windows to enable recording with the `-R` option: right-click on the Jamulus shortcut and choose "Properties" > Target. Add the necessary arguments to Jamulus.exe:

`"C:\Program Files (x86)\Jamulus\Jamulus.exe" -s -R "C:\path\to\your\Jam Recordings"`

For Macintosh, start a Terminal window and run Jamulus with the desired options like this:

`/Applications/Jamulus.app/Contents/MacOS/Jamulus -s -R "/path/to/your/jam recordings"`

***

You can see all possible options your version supports by starting Jamulus with the `-h` option.
