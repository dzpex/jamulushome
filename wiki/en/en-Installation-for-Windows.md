# Installation for Windows

1. **Download and install an ASIO Driver**. It is recommended to use a sound card/interface with a native ASIO driver. If you don't have one, install [this free ASIO driver (ASIO4All)](http://www.asio4all.org)  **before** installing Jamulus.

1. **Afterwards [download and run the Jamulus Windows installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/llcon/files/)**. If you get a warning notice, click on "More info" and "Run anyway" to install Jamulus. 

1. **Setup your sound card**. When you're done, have a look at how to setup ASIO4All if you you're using that (scroll down), and afterwards at [Hardware Setup](Hardware-Setup).

You can also [compile your own binary](Compiling) if you feel so inclined. 

## Setting up ASIO4All
*ASIO4All is not recommended if your audio interface provides its own ASIO driver, since that might have better latency.*

First of all **close all applications** (especially those which could access your soundcard like your browser) to minimize conflicts. If the audio doesnâ€™t work out of the box, make sure that only the **correct inputs/outputs** in its control panel **are switched on**. 
You may need to experiment a bit to find the right ones since every computer is a bit different. Do this while you're connected to a server to hear your instrument or voice and check if everything is correctly setup.

### How to setup ASIO4All inputs (Guide)

1. Open Jamulus's settings
1. Go to _"ASIO Settings"_
1. Enable _advanced view_ in ASIO4All (click the tool icon on the bottom right)
1. Open your soundcard inputs by clicking the _plus icon_ next to the soundcard name. 
1. Now enable/disable the correct inputs/outputs

Many internal sound cards are named Realtek High Definition Audio, Conexant or similar. 
Headphones and speakers are often labeled as output and microphones as inputs.

### Having trouble with ASIO4All setup?

Although ASIO4All might work out of the box, you might also experience problems with its setup.

If nothing works, first of all try to **restart Jamulus and/or your PC**.
Afterwards try to **setup the inputs/outputs again**. Enabled and accessible inputs/outputs show a lit up on/off button and a play button. If you see a red cross or a yellow symbol, you might need to close other applications like your browser, Zoom, ...

Have a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/_GzOsitVgLI) from @trombonepizza which gives more detailed setup information on ASIO4All.

Official and more detailed info about how to configure ASIO4All is documented in the ASIO4All manual. This can most likely be found on your desktop or in the folder where the ASIO4All binary is installed (usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\ASIO4ALL v2\`).

## All installed?
Jamulus has been installed and can be used now. If you haven't set up your audio gear yet, have a look at [Hardware Setup](Hardware-Setup).

For detailed information on using Jamulus, please see the [help manual](https://github.com/corrados/jamulus/blob/master/src/res/homepage/manual.md).
