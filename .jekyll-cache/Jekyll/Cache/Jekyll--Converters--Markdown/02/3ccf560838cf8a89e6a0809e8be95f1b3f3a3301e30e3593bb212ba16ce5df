<h2 id="you-will-need">You will need</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A computer</strong> running either <strong>Windows 10</strong>, <strong>MacOS X</strong> El Capitan (v10.11) or higher, or <strong>Linux</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A wired internet connection</strong> (don‚Äôt use Wi-Fi, it will cause sound problems). Most broadband connections will be fine (<a href="Quality,-delay-and-network-bandwidth">full details here</a>). If you have 10Mbits down and 1Mbps up, you‚Äôre unlikely to run into bandwidth-related issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Wired headphones - not speakers</strong> to prevent echo or feedback and (particularity if singing or playing acoustic instruments) to make sure you keep in time with others (see the <a href="Getting-Started#having-trouble-cant-keep-in-time">note on this</a> for why).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="highly-recommended-an-audio-interface">Highly recommended: an audio interface!</h3>

<p>Unless you are a musician with a (USB) microphone, then to avoid latency you are strongly advised to use an audio interface: a box that you can plug your instrument(s) into rather than using your computer‚Äôs built-in sound card. The interface will connect to your PC usually via USB. See <a href="Hardware-Setup">Hardware Setup</a>.</p>

<h3 id="minimise-interruptions">Minimise interruptions!</h3>

<p>Minimizing ‚Äúlatency‚Äù (signal delay) is crucial for playing successfully together. While using Jamulus, try to make sure that nothing else on your machine or your network is competing against it. Don‚Äôt watch YouTube/Netflix, or have anything else running on the machine that you are using Jamulus on.</p>

<h3 id="ping-time">Ping time!</h3>

<p>Always connect to servers with the <strong>lowest ping times</strong> as shown in your server list. 15ms or below will give you the best chance of having a good time (although there‚Äôs other things that affect performance too). Anything higher and you‚Äôre taking your chances.</p>

<h1 id="having-trouble-cant-keep-in-time">Having trouble? Can‚Äôt keep in time?</h1>

<p><strong>ONLY. LISTEN. TO. THE. SIGNAL. FROM. THE. SERVER!</strong></p>

<p>Or put another way, do <strong>not</strong> listen to your direct signal.</p>

<p>This is obviously hard for singers and some acoustic musicians, but even if your connection is good, when players aren‚Äôt listening to their <strong>own signal coming back from the server</strong>, your synchronisation <strong>will</strong> suffer. <em>(For the avoidance of doubt: this has nothing to do with the ‚Äúmute‚Äù controls in Jamulus.)</em></p>

<p>Further information about how to avoid listening to yourself (and help with other problems) can be found in the <a href="Client-Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting FAQ section</a> (<em>currently under construction</em>)</p>

<h2 id="how-jamulus-works-in-general">How Jamulus works (in general)</h2>

<p><strong>Here‚Äôs how millions of people are using Jamulus to play, sing and teach music with other people in real time, all over the world:</strong></p>

<em>Jamulus works on the client server principle. Everybody‚Äôs audio is sent to a server, mixed and processed there. Afterwards the audio is sent to every client. If a server is made public and registered on a central server, its information will be broadcasted to all clients.</em></p>
